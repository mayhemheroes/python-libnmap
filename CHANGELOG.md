## [v0.4.8] - 05/05/2014

### Changed

- Changes in OS fingerprint data API
- NmapHost now holds its OS fingerprint data in NmapHost.os (NmapOSFingerpring object)
- fingerprint is now a property which means you have to call it without (); e.g.: NmapHost.os.fingerprint
- NmapHost.os.fingerprints return an array of os fingerprints (strings)
- NmapHost.os.fingerprint return a concatenated string of all fingerprints
- Fingerprints data are now accessible via NmapHost.os.osmatches which returns a list of NmapOSMatch objects
- NmapOSMatch objects might contain a list of NmapOSClass objects matching with it
- NmapOSClass objects might contain a list of CPE object related to the os class (CPE class will be improved and API enriched)

## [v0.4.7] - 03/05/2014

### Added

- added support for <owner> if present in <port>: accessible via NmapService.owner

## [v0.4.5] - 06/04/2014

### Added

- Added "incomplete" argument in NmapReport.parse() in order to enable parsing of incomplete or interrupted nmap scans. Could be useful to use with a background scan to parse incomplete data blocks from callback function (thanks @Sibwara for the idea).

## [v0.4.3] - 14/03/2014

### Changed

  - NmapHost.address property returns the IPv4 or IPv6 or MAC in that preference order. Use specific calls for determinists results
  - NmapService.scripts_results is now a property
  - NmapService.scripts_results return an array of scripts results

### Added

- Added new properties in hosts object API:
  - NmapHost.ipv4
  - NmapHost.ipv6

### Fixed

- Fixed #issue8: There is no guarantee that "finished" or "runstats" will be received by event parser of process.py.
